# Canyon Crosser
Build a volumetric visionOS app with RealityKit and SwiftUI.

Canyon Crosser demonstrates how RealityKit and SwiftUI work together to display 3D content.  
The app launches into a swipe-able collection of landmarks in a carousel.
After selecting a landmark, you'll see a virtual model of the Grand Canyon, allowing you to interact with the trailheads and rest stops while exploring the Bright Angel trail.
