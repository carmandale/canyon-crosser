    static let trailOfTimeDescription = """
    The Trail of Time spans 2.83 miles across the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. As hikers walk the trail, they can see the geologic time that the canyon's rock layers represent. Each meter of the trail is one million years of geologic history. This allows hikers to walk through the formation of this canyon and conceptualize how it was created over billions of years.
    
    Throughout the hike, there are many rest stops and exhibits that explain further about the geologic timeline that they are hiking through. Some of these include rock samples, informational signs, and interactive displays that explain how the Grand Canyon was formed. Visitors of all ages can learn more about erosion, sedimentation, tectonic plate activity, and more.
    
    The trail makes many visitors reflect on the way in which the Earth changes so vastly over time. The perspective of the enormous amounts of time that they're walking through, reflected over just a few meters of hiking, encourages visitors to remember how briefly humanity has existed on Earth and to have a greater appreciation for natural history.

    static let matherPointDescription = """
    Located near the park's main entrance, Mather Point is the starting point for hiking the canyon for many visitors. It's named after Stephen Mather, who was the first National Park Service director and played a large part in preserving national parks across the country.
    
    The viewpoint starts with a very short and paved trail, which makes it a popular choice for many visitors due to its accessibility. It showcases the canyon's beautiful rock formations and colors, as well as the Colorado River. It also has multiple platforms with railing for safe viewing.
    
    Mather Point is also a destination for many to learn more about the park. Park rangers gather here to give talks or guided hikes so visitors can learn more about the history and geology of the park. These educational experiences enrich hikers' visits and help them appreciate the canyon even further.

    static let brightAngelDescription = """
    The Bright Angel Trail is a popular 9.5 mile hiking trail in the Grand Canyon. It has a challenging path, but is accessible enough for most to hike and long enough to explore a lot of the canyon. It starts near the Bright Angel Lodge at the South Rim and ends at the Colorado River. It offers an incredible view of the canyon's ecological and geological marvels. It has multiple rest stops; the 1.5 Mile Resthouse, the 3 Mile Resthouse, and the Havasupai Gardens. This allows hikers to pause for water, the restroom, or some shade.
    
    The trail offers amazing views of the layered rock formations, which provide insight to the millions of years of history that they have been created over. It also showcases the different landscapes that exist in the canyon, like the desert at the top to the beautiful oasis in the Gardens.
    
    The trail also tells a story of the history of the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai people used the trail for centuries for trade and travel. Today, people from around the world still come to the trail to experience the beauty and the wonders of the canyon.
    """
    
    static let havasupaiGardensDescription = """
    Havasupai Gardens, which used to be called Indian Garden, is a lush sanctuary in the Grand Canyon. It's very welcome to hikers as it's a distinct opposite to the arid desert of Arizona. The plant life and wildlife thrive off of small streams fed by springs. Without these streams, animals and plants wouldn't be able to survive in the desert climate.

    The gardens are a significant cultural site for the Havasupai Tribe. They used the gardens as a farming site and cultivated crops like squash, beans, and corn. Without the springs, none of these crops would have survived. The gardens were renamed from Indian Garden to Havasupai Gardens in 2022, as a step towards the tribe's connection to the land and their historical presence in the canyon.
    
    The Havasupai gardens is a very popular rest stop for visitors due to the campground it offers, as well as the restrooms, water, and lush greenery. Many hikers pause to take in the beauty and learn more about the history of the area.
    """

    static let threeMileResthouseDescription = """
    The 3 Mile Resthouse is a rest stop on the Bright Angel Trail. As named, it's three miles from the trailhead and offers beautiful panoramic views of the canyon. Its elevation is 4,748 feet, so visitors can see much of the expanse of the canyon as well as the incredible layered rock formations. This spot is popular for both hikers going down and back up the trail due to the tiresome climb and high elevation.
    
    The resthouse contains restrooms, water, and shade, which makes it very important on a strenuous trail. It also is a place of connection, where hikers share adventures with each other and meet visitors from across the world. As one of the most popular trails in the park, the spot is well-traveled and many hikers pause to appreciate the hike as well and connect with their fellow visitors.
    """
    
    static let endOfTrailDescription = """
    The 9.5 mile Bright Angel Trail ends at the Colorado River, where hikers can see the towering walls of the Grand Canyon as well as the beautiful river flowing right in front of them. The amazing colors of the rock layers and the cliffs shine in the sunlight and display the millions of years of geology of the canyon.
    
    The Bright Angel Campground is at the edge of the Colorado River and offers a place to stay overnight for visitors. There's water, restrooms, picnic tables, and a place to set up tents. There's also rooms for visitors and a restaurant at the Phantom Ranch in the heart of the canyon, which creates an opportunity for visitors to venture further into the canyon, go to other trails, or just rest without needing to provide for themselves.
    
    This area is also historically and culturally significant. In the past, it was inhabited by indigenous peoples who left behind artifacts and petroglyphs. It's important for visitors to be careful around, and respect these cultural items. This beautiful area is a reminder to visitors of the importance of preserving the landscape for all future generations.
